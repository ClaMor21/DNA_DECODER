# DNA-CIPHER_DECODER-CODE FELLAS HACKTHAON 
A DNA Cryptography can be defined as hiding data in terms of DNA Sequence. Just like the RSA and DES algorithms, in DNA Cryptology users have DNA algorithms like “Public-key system using DNA as a one-way function for key distribution,” “DNASC cryptography system”, DNA Steganography Systems, Triple stage DNA Cryptography, Encryption algorithm inspired by DNA and Chaotic computing.
